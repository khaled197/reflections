When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When i am working on a common project with other people so we all be able to access its repository or when i work on a project 
from different places so i can access it from any computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there might be some updates that i don't want to share with others. Also i might want to add more things before sharing it. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clones are just copies of a repository made either from GitHub to a computer or from a local computer to another.
forks are similar to clones however they are made from a repository in one account on GitHub to another account.
branches are new groups of commits in the same repository.
