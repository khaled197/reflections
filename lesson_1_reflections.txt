How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it showed me the diff betweeen the two files so that i could see why the error occured.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

tracking down changes occured on a file over time helps me know what change was beneficial and what was not and why so that in future i can avoid previous mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

the pros:
it helps me choose the appropriate time to create a commit based on the the importance of the change.

the cons:
if i forgot to create a commit or something urgent happened that prevented me from doing that, the changes wll be lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think the reason is that people use Git for things that are more likely to be related to each other like code files, so if one file needs a change, the other will need that change too.
while Other systems like Google docs are used for files that are mostly intended to be separate than related.
