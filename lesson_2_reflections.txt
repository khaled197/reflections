What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a folder named .git is created, to convert a normal directory into a git repository so that i can track the history of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory contains all my files.
The repository contains the commits that were created.
The staging area contains the files that i would like to create a commit for them.
